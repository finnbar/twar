twar
====

twar - a game where you code on twitter in lua to synthesise blocks, build and conquer!

what is this madness?!
=======================

this is a game where you tweet code, which causes stuff to happen online. you can build units out of blocks and then control them, which is cool!

this is in development, right?
==============================

correctamondo my friend!

how can I help?
===============

ooh, thanks! you can help by checking over my scruffy code, and once I've finished the basics (which AREN'T finished yet), you can add stuff to it!

what are you actually aiming to do?
===================================

see http://ideasquish.wordpress.com/2013/06/27/twitter-war-by-terrabyte_aura/ (I am terrabyte_aura, btw), and the temp_api.lua file to see what I want to achieve!

is there going to be a GUI?
===========================

yes there is! I'm going to write it in Polycode or LOVE2D, so yeah!

you seem awesome
================

thank you! you seem awesome too!
